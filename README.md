# PennChats

Created during PennApps 2016. The objective was to create a web application that students at Penn can access during class to chat with other peers in the class. Students could upload their ical schedule into the service in order to be added to their course chat rooms. All of the messages sent during class would be erased after class was over in order to add the element of ephemerality to the application. This was to allow students to freely ask questions during class if they were shy, did not want to disturb the professor, or missed a concept during the lecture. 

This application was created with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. We used Pubnub to implement the messaging component, Parse to create the database of students, and Bootstrap for some of the frontend components of the web application.
